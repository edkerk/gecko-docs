# GECKO Documentation

Documentation for GECKO, a MATLAB toolbox, and geckopy, its Python port, for
reconstructing, simulating and analyzing enzyme-constrained genome-scale
metabolic models (ecModels). Built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/),
[MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) and
[pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/), matching
the [raven-docs](https://github.com/edkerk/raven-docs) setup for RAVEN and
raven-toolbox.

Alongside the Guide, the site includes an auto-generated **API reference**
that documents both implementations side by side, statically extracted at
build time from each toolbox's source (pulled in as git submodules). See
[API reference (MATLAB + Python)](#api-reference-matlab--python) below.

## Building locally

```bash
# from the repository root
git submodule update --init --recursive   # fetch the GECKO + geckopy sources
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-sphinx.txt
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

The `git submodule update --init` step is required: without it the `GECKO/`
and `geckopy/` source trees are empty and the API reference builds with no
functions in it.

Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a browser. There is no live-reload dev
server configured; re-run `sphinx-build` after editing.

## Hosting on Read the Docs

1. Push this folder to a GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket repository.
2. Sign in at https://readthedocs.org/ and import the repository.
3. Read the Docs detects `.readthedocs.yaml` and builds the site
   automatically on every push.

Read the Docs initializes the git submodules automatically because
`.readthedocs.yaml` sets `submodules.include: all`, so the API reference is
built on every push without any extra configuration.

## API reference (MATLAB + Python)

`docs/api/` documents both toolboxes side by side, plus
`docs/matlab-vs-python.md`, a generated table pairing every function that
exists in both. All of it is written by `scripts/gen_api_pages_sphinx.py`
at build time (run from `docs/conf.py`'s `setup()` hook), which extracts
MATLAB help blocks and Python docstrings directly from source: no MATLAB
runtime, no installed geckopy package, and no live-rendering plugin
involved. Nothing under `docs/api/` or `docs/matlab-vs-python.md` is
checked into the repository or should be hand-edited; regenerate by
rebuilding. Function pairs that don't match by name alone (geckopy renamed
part of the API during the port) are recorded in `scripts/curated_pairs.yml`,
which is validated against the live source at build time.

Sources are git submodules pinned to each project's tracked development
branch (see `.gitmodules`):

- `GECKO/`   — [SysBioChalmers/GECKO](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO) (MATLAB)
- `geckopy/` — [SysBioChalmers/geckopy](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/geckopy) (Python)

To refresh the reference against the latest upstream code:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --recursive
git add GECKO geckopy
git commit -m "chore: update submodules to latest tracked branches"
```

(`.github/workflows/update-submodules.yml` does this automatically on a
daily schedule.)
