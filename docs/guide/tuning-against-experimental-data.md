# Tuning against experimental data

:::{note} Python only
This workflow is currently available in geckopy only, with no MATLAB
GECKO equivalent. Every code block on this page is Python.
:::

[Growth-rate tuning](growth-rate-tuning.md) raises kcats one at a time
until a single target growth rate is reached. `cmaes_kcat_tuning` instead
fits many kcats at once, with CMA-ES, against a full set of measured
growth rates and fluxes across several conditions, weighted by how much
each kcat's source is trusted. This page covers one recommended path
through that fitting process end to end. It is not a full reference; the
docstrings in `geckopy.kcat_tuning.evotune` document every option.

## Functions on this page

| Python | |
|---|---|
| `screen_kcat_leverage` | report which kcats the data can inform, before any tuning runs |
| `review_assignment` | check kcat values for assignment mistakes, independent of the data |
| `cmaes_kcat_tuning` | search the tunable kcats with CMA-ES for the best fit to measured data |
| `result.corrections` | turn the tuning result into a reviewable list of changes |

## What this does

An ecModel's kcats mostly come from databases (BRENDA), predictors
(DLKcat, OpenKineticsPredictor), or manual curation (see
[Gathering kcats](gathering-kcats.md) and
[Applying kcats](applying-kcats.md)), and they do not on their own
reproduce measured growth. Three functions, run in sequence, turn measured
data into corrections:

1. **`screen_kcat_leverage`** reports which kcats the data can actually
   inform: no optimization runs yet, only "if this kcat were different,
   how much would the fit change." This is useful for curation on its own,
   before any tuning run.
2. **`select_tunable_mask`** turns that report into the set of kcats a
   tuning run searches over. It runs automatically if skipped.
3. **`cmaes_kcat_tuning`** searches that set with CMA-ES for the kcat
   vector that best matches the data, weighted by how much each kcat's
   source is trusted.

A fourth function, **`review_assignment`**, is complementary rather than
part of that sequence: it checks the kcats themselves for assignment
mistakes, independent of any measured data, since the tuner's largest
corrections are usually places the assignment went wrong rather than
discoveries about biology (see
[Check the assignments behind the top kcats](#check-the-assignments-behind-the-top-kcats)
below).

The result is usually a short list of corrections, each with a
before/after value and a source, not a wholesale rewrite of the model. A
run that changes nearly every kcat by a little has not found anything; a
run that changes a handful by a lot, concentrated in the least-trusted
sources, has.

## Before you start

- A working ecModel and `ModelAdapter` project: an existing
  `model_adapter.toml` and `models/*.yml` (see
  [Getting started](getting-started.md) and
  [Building an empty ecModel](building-ec-model.md)).
- `pip install geckopy[evotune]`. The CMA-ES search (`cma`) is an optional
  dependency, not part of the base install.
- Experimental data: at least one of a set of measured exchange fluxes per
  condition, or a set of measured maximum growth rates per carbon source.
  Both together works and is preferred, since flux data pins the shape of
  metabolism and growth rate pins its rate.

## Prepare the experimental data

Three tab-separated files go under `<project>/data/`. All three are
optional; a missing file is skipped rather than an error, but at least one
of the first two is required.

| File | Contents | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `evotuneFluxData.tsv` | Measured exchange fluxes, one row per condition. | At least one of these two |
| `evotuneMaxGrowth.tsv` | Measured maximum growth rate, one row per condition, one active carbon source per row (at `-1000`, unconstrained). | |
| `evotuneZeroExch.tsv` | Reaction IDs assumed to carry zero flux in every condition. | No |

The two flux files share one column layout, the same parser geckopy uses
for regular flux data:

```
Condition   Ptot   grRate   glucose (r_1714)   fructose (r_1709)   ...   evotuneRMSEweight   source
glucose     NaN    0.41     -1000              NaN                ...   1                     DLKcat
fructose    NaN    0.338    NaN                -1000              ...   1                     DLKcat
```

`Condition` names the row; `grRate` is the measured growth rate; `Ptot` is
measured protein content (`NaN` if not measured); each `<met> (<rxn>)`
column is a measured or fixed flux for that exchange reaction;
`evotuneRMSEweight` scales how much that row counts toward the RMSE
(usually `1`); and `source` is free text carried through for bookkeeping.
`evotuneZeroExch.tsv` is simpler: a `Rxns` header, then one reaction ID per
line.

## Configure evotune in model_adapter.toml

Every field has a default, so this section can be omitted entirely to
start. A configured example, in plain terms:

```toml
[evotune]
sigma0_log_default = 0.3   # trust for any source not listed below
max_growth_weight = 2.0    # weight the growth-rate data double against flux data

[evotune.source_groups.okp]
sources = ["OpenKineticsPredictor"]
match_okp = true

[evotune.source_groups.brenda]
sources = ["brenda"]

[evotune.source_groups.custom]
sources = ["custom"]

[evotune.sigma0_log_source]
okp = 0.25
brenda = 0.2
custom = 0.1
```

What each setting controls:

- **Trust tiers** (`source_groups`, `sigma0_log_source` and
  `sigma0_log_default`). Group kcats by how much their origin is trusted,
  and give each group a standard deviation in log-space: a smaller value
  means more trust, so the search needs stronger evidence before moving
  that kcat far. `custom` (curated by hand) at 0.1 is three times more
  trusted than an unlabelled prediction at 0.3. This is the one section
  with no universal default; the right tiers depend on the model's own
  source labels.
- **`max_growth_weight`** (default `1.0`). The combined score is
  `(rmse_flux + w * rmse_max_growth) / (w + 1)`. At `2`, growth-rate error
  counts double against flux error, useful when growth rate is measured
  across many carbon sources but flux is mostly measured for one.
- **`prior_penalty_weight`** (default `0.03`, already on). Adds
  `w * mean(((log k - log k0) / sigma0)^2)` to the score: a charge for
  moving a kcat, scaled by how much its prior is trusted. Without this
  term the fit is often flat along many directions: several very
  different kcat vectors fit equally well, and the search returns an
  arbitrary point along that flat direction, one that does not reproduce
  when rerun with a different seed. The default is calibrated so that
  large corrections agree in direction and land within a handful of fold
  of each other across seeds, at a small cost in raw fit. Setting it to
  `0` scores on fit alone, which is also what a run reproducing GECKO
  MATLAB, which has no such term, must do. The right strength depends on
  the model and the data, since it scales with `sigma0_log` and the
  objective itself; `tune_prior_penalty_weight` runs a candidate sweep and
  reports fit cost against cross-seed reproducibility so the value does
  not have to be picked blind (see its docstring). It costs one full
  tuning run per candidate per seed, so treat it as an occasional
  calibration step rather than part of routine tuning.
- **`tie_isozymes`** (default `true`). Several ecModel reactions are one
  enzymatic reaction split across isozyme copies. When copies share a
  prior value and a source, no experimental condition can distinguish
  between them, so an untied search can assign them a difference that
  carries no biological meaning. Tying gives such copies one shared kcat.
- **`max_generations` / `rmse_threshold`**. This search's stopping
  conditions: run at most this many CMA-ES generations, or stop earlier
  once the best RMSE reaches `rmse_threshold` (negative never stops
  early).

## Screen which kcats the data can inform

```python
from geckopy import ModelAdapter, load_ec_model
from geckopy.kcat_tuning.evotune import screen_kcat_leverage

adapter = ModelAdapter.from_folder("path/to/project")
model = load_ec_model(adapter=adapter)  # models/ecModel.yml by default

screen = screen_kcat_leverage(model, adapter=adapter, n_proc=8)
screen.drop(columns="_positions").head(20)
```

This perturbs every tunable kcat, moving isozyme copies together per
`tie_isozymes`, up and down, and measures how much the fit changes; no
tuning happens yet. The result is a table, one row per kcat or tied group,
ranked by that leverage weighted by trust: the reaction ID, how many
isozyme copies it covers, its source group, its current value, its
leverage, and `cum_leverage_share`, the running fraction of total leverage
carried by this row and every row above it. The top rows are what a
curator should look at first, independent of whether a tuning search ever
runs: on ecYeastGEM, a handful of kcats routinely carry the majority of
what any tuning run could achieve, and they tend to be implausible
database values rather than genuine biology.

This costs one simulation per condition per kcat group, roughly comparable
in scale to a full tuning run's budget; expect tens of minutes on a
genome-scale model, not a quick check. `n_proc` parallelizes it the same
way tuning does.

## Check the assignments behind the top kcats

Before spending a tuning run on a kcat, check whether the value was
assigned correctly in the first place. `review_assignment` flags
source-level problems: a value with no kcat row behind it for its EC, one
number reused across many unrelated reactions, an EC's maximum standing in
for a whole distribution, an implausible magnitude, or a curated value
that repeats what the database already said. These are corrections to
the source, so they belong in whatever database or fuzzy-matching step in
[Gathering kcats](gathering-kcats.md) produced the value; fixing them there
propagates to every model built from the same data, unlike a value the
tuner moves for this one model alone.

```python
from geckopy.gather_kcats.review import EcStats, review_assignment, findings_tsv

# One EcStats per EC code queried while gathering kcats, summarising
# whatever kcat database (usually BRENDA) the assignment came from.
ec_stats = {
    "1.1.1.1": EcStats(n_kcat=12, kcat_max=340.0, kcat_median=45.0,
                       values=frozenset({340.0, 45.0, 12.0}), n_sa=0),
    # ...
}

findings = review_assignment(
    model.ec.rxns, model.ec.kcat, model.ec.source, model.ec.eccodes,
    ec_stats=ec_stats,
)
print(findings_tsv(findings))
```

Each `Finding` names a reaction, its checks (`no-ec-evidence`,
`repeated-value`, `ec-maximum`, `magnitude`, `custom-duplicate`), and a
human-readable `detail`. Isozyme copies the assignment could not
distinguish, the same grouping `tie_isozymes` uses above, are reported
once, not once per copy. Standard fallbacks and tied groups are deliberate choices
rather than mistakes, so neither is reported unless explicitly requested
via `include`.

Findings rank by `leverage` when it is passed in, reusing the `screen`
table from the previous step, expanded from tie-groups back to individual
`model.ec.rxns` positions via its `_positions` column, so that looking odd
and actually mattering are not confused; without it, rows come back in
input order, and looking odd is all that remains. `coverage` (a share of
flagged leverage) or `top` (a row count) then truncates the report: on
ecYeastGEM, tightening the checks themselves does not work half as well as
this does, since `coverage=0.8` cuts 2,575 unfiltered rows to 33, and the
first row alone carries half.

## Tune

```python
from geckopy import save_ec_model
from geckopy.kcat_tuning.evotune import cmaes_kcat_tuning

result = cmaes_kcat_tuning(
    model, adapter=adapter, screen=screen, n_proc=8, seed=0,
)

save_ec_model(model, "ecModel_tuned.yml", adapter=adapter)
```

Passing the screen from the earlier step avoids recomputing it; omitting
`screen` entirely makes `cmaes_kcat_tuning` compute one itself. Either way,
the tunable set is built by `select_tunable_mask`, which keeps the fewest
highest-ranked kcats whose combined leverage reaches `target_impact_share`
(default `0.9`) of the total: a cutoff relative to the model's own
achievable improvement, not a fixed count or an absolute leverage value, so
the same setting means a comparable thing on a different model. Pass
`tunable_mask` directly to fix the set by hand instead.

`model` is mutated in place: on return, every tunable kcat carries the
best value CMA-ES found, and the model's kcat constraints are already
applied, so nothing further is needed before simulating or saving it.
Beyond `target_impact_share`, the only other knobs are `popsize` (CMA-ES's
population size, defaulting to its own dimension-scaled choice rather than
a value tuned for one particular model), `n_proc`, and `seed`; everything
else comes from the same configuration as the previous step, so there is
nothing new to configure once that section is read.

If growth needs special handling for the organism, for example forcing
anaerobic conditions or scaling the protein pool with a
condition-specific biomass composition, pass `make_anaerobic` and/or
`change_protein_biomass` callables; geckopy has no organism-agnostic
default for either. `tutorials/full_ecModel/code/anaerobic.py` in the
geckopy repository has a worked example.

## Read the result

`result` is an `EvotuneResult`:

- `rmse_trace` / `objective_trace`: best-so-far plain-fit RMSE and
  best-so-far optimized objective, per generation (identical unless
  `prior_penalty_weight` is nonzero). A flat trace for many generations
  before the run ends means it stalled, not converged.
- `new_kcat` / `old_kcat` / `rxns` / `groups`: the tuned and prior kcats
  over the searched set, parallel arrays, with each kcat's trust tier.
  Tied isozyme copies share one value in `new_kcat`.
- `converged`: whether `rmse_threshold` was reached, or `max_generations`
  was hit first.
- `n_generations`: how many generations actually ran.

Before trusting a tuned kcat, check more than the final RMSE:

1. **How many kcats changed, and by how much.** A result that moves
   nearly everything by a little has not identified anything.
   `geckopy.kcat_tuning.evotune.parsimony` has the tools for this:
   `n_changed`, `fold_change`, `source_movement`.
2. **Impact share.** `parsimony.impact_share` reports what fraction of the
   total achievable improvement the changed kcats actually carry,
   distinguishing "few, large and consequential" from mere sparsity. This
   is a different, unweighted quantity from `screen_kcat_leverage`'s
   trust-weighted `cum_leverage_share`.
3. **Reproducibility.** Rerun with a different `seed`. Large corrections
   (beyond roughly two-fold) should land in the same direction and within
   a small factor of each other; if they do not, the search has found a
   flat direction rather than a real correction, and `prior_penalty_weight`
   is the first setting to reach for.
4. **Whether it generalizes.** If data exists that was not fit on, score
   the tuned model against it and compare to the untuned model. A large
   improvement on fitted conditions with no improvement elsewhere is a
   sign of overfitting to a thin dataset, not a fixed model.

`new_kcat`/`old_kcat` is thousands of numbers, most of them unchanged, not
something a reviewer can read directly. `result.corrections()` turns it
into the actual review artifact: one `Correction` row per changed kcat
(reaction, EC code, source, prior/tuned value, fold change), ranked by
leverage rather than by how far a kcat moved, so parameters the data
cannot see, which are free to drift furthest and are the least reliable,
sort to the bottom instead of the top:

```python
from geckopy.kcat_tuning import annotate_from_model, corrections_tsv

# screen is the table from "Screen which kcats the data can inform" above; reuse
# it rather than recomputing leverage.
leverage_by_rxn = dict(zip(screen["rxn_id"], screen["leverage"]))
leverage = [leverage_by_rxn.get(r, 0.0) for r in result.rxns]

annotations = annotate_from_model(model, result.rxns)
rows = result.corrections(leverage=leverage, **annotations)
open("corrections.tsv", "w").write(corrections_tsv(rows))
```

`cumulative_share` on each row is the running fraction of total leverage
the list has accounted for so far, so a reader can stop reading once it
stops climbing. This is the tuning-time counterpart to `review_assignment`
above: that step flags kcats that need curation before a run; this one
reports which ones the run actually changed, and how much each change can
be trusted.

## Why CMA-ES, not ABC-SMC

DLKcat's own Bayesian approach to kcat tuning implements ABC-SMC
(Approximate Bayesian Computation, Sequential Monte Carlo); see
[SysBioChalmers/DLKcat/BayesianApproach](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/DLKcat/tree/master/BayesianApproach).
geckopy's `kcat_tuning.evotune` module ported that approach faithfully and
tested it side by side with CMA-ES, a plain optimizer, on the same
objective, the same screened parameter set and the same experimental data
(ecYeastGEM, 41 conditions). CMA-ES won on every criterion checked, which
is why it is what geckopy ships.

ABC-SMC is a sampler: each generation it draws a batch of candidate kcat
vectors from a proposal distribution, scores them, and keeps the best
fraction to seed the next generation's proposals. That machinery, a
posterior approximation, a sample schedule and truncation selection, earns
its keep when the goal is a distribution over plausible parameter values
and the model is cheap enough to sample densely across the whole parameter
space. Once a screen has reduced the problem to the kcats the data can
actually inform (a few dozen to a few hundred, out of thousands), that
premise stops holding: there is no longer a broad space to sample across,
and each evaluation is expensive, one FBA solve per condition. At that
point the problem is a direct search for the best-fitting vector, which is
what an optimizer is for and not what ABC-SMC is for.

On the same model, the same 112-parameter screen, the same objective and
three seeds each:

| | Distance | Spread across seeds |
|---|---|---|
| ABC-SMC | 0.9156 | +/- 0.0549 |
| **CMA-ES** | **0.7974** | **+/- 0.0048** |

CMA-ES fits better by 3.7 standard errors, with a spread more than ten
times tighter. The gap is not only fit quality; it also determines whether
an individual tuned kcat means anything. Both methods leave most kcats on
flat directions the data cannot pin down, but ABC-SMC's posterior sampling
spreads its samples across the whole flat region: across three ABC-SMC seeds,
lanosterol synthase, the single highest-leverage kcat in the model, took
values of 0.338, 20.3 and 0.0781 s^-1, a 260-fold spread, at distances
differing by only 0.009. A number that unstable cannot be reported as a
finding.

CMA-ES does not remove flat directions; nothing can, since they are a
property of the data rather than of the search method. A direct optimizer
converges to one point per flat direction instead of sampling across it,
and `prior_penalty_weight`, a Tikhonov-style penalty on moving away from
the prior, weighted by how much each source is trusted, picks out which
point.
