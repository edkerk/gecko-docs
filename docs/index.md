  <img class="gd-hero-logo" src="_static/gecko-logo.png" alt="GECKO">
  <p class="gd-tag">MATLAB &amp; Python</p>
  <p class="gd-tagline">Reconstruction, simulation and analysis of enzyme-constrained metabolic models (ecModels): a MATLAB toolbox built on RAVEN, and geckopy, a Python port built on cobrapy.</p>
</div>

## Install

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Python (PyPI)

```bash
pip install --pre geckopy
```

`--pre` is required while geckopy and raven-toolbox are pre-releases on
PyPI.
:::
:::{tab-item} Python (Git)

```bash
pip install \
    git+https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/raven-toolbox.git@develop \
    git+https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/geckopy.git@develop
```

Tracks the `develop` branch of both packages, ahead of the latest PyPI
release.
:::
:::{tab-item} MATLAB (Add-Ons)

Home → Add-Ons → Get Add-Ons → search "GECKO Toolbox".
:::
:::{tab-item} MATLAB (git)

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/GECKO
```

Then run `GECKOInstaller.install` in MATLAB.

## Key features

::::{grid} 1 2 3 3

:::{grid-item-card} Enzyme constraints
Convert a conventional GEM into an ecModel by bounding reaction rates with
enzyme kcat and abundance.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Proteomics integration
Constrain individual enzyme usage with absolute or relative proteomics
measurements.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Light ecModels
A smaller, faster-simulating ecModel variant for when full proteome coverage
isn't needed.
:::

::::

## Quick start

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} 🐍 Python
:sync: python

```python
from geckopy import load_ec_model

# load a previously built ecModel
model = load_ec_model("ecYeastGEM.yml")

# set growth as the objective
model.objective = "r_2111"

# run FBA -- simulation comes from cobrapy, unchanged
sol = model.optimize()
print(f"Growth rate: {sol.objective_value:.4f} h⁻¹")
```
:::
:::{tab-item} Ⓜ️ MATLAB
:sync: matlab

```matlab
% load a previously built ecModel
model = loadEcModel('ecYeastGEM.yml');

% set growth as the objective
model = setParam(model, 'obj', 'r_2111', 1);

% run FBA
sol = solveLP(model);
fprintf('Growth rate: %.4f h-1\n', sol.f);
```

and Docker for DLKcat.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} GECKO vs. geckopy
:link: gecko-to-geckopy
:link-type: doc

Which to use for what, what only one of them has, and where the same
function gives a different answer.
